## Overview

**KAI OS** reimagines the traditional portfolio site as a small, self-contained *operating system*: a public-facing interface that presents projects, research, skills, education, and certifications, backed by a private **admin dashboard** for managing all of that content without touching code, and an integrated **AI assistant ("KAI")** that can converse with visitors about the portfolio's contents using retrieval-augmented generation.

It's built as a decoupled system — a FastAPI backend exposing a REST API, and a modular vanilla JavaScript frontend that consumes it — so the two can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Content Management** — Projects, research, skills, education, certifications, and resume are all stored in a database and editable through a dedicated admin panel, not hardcoded into the frontend.
- **AI Portfolio Assistant (KAI)** — A conversational assistant that classifies visitor intent, retrieves relevant portfolio data, builds context, and generates grounded answers via the Groq LLM API.
- **Secure Admin Authentication** — JWT-based login (OAuth2 password flow) with hashed credentials via `passlib`/`bcrypt`.
- **File Uploads** — Support for avatar, project, and resume file uploads, served through a dedicated static endpoint.
- **Modular Frontend Architecture** — Feature-based modules (projects, skills, education, certifications, research, contact, home) with a lightweight custom router and state manager — no framework overhead.
- **Separate Admin SPA** — An isolated admin interface (`/frontend/admin`) with its own pages, components, and services for managing all portfolio data.
- **REST API** — Clean, versioned FastAPI routes for every resource, with auto-generated interactive docs (Swagger / ReDoc).

### How the AI assistant works

1. **Intent Classifier** — determines what the visitor is asking about (projects, skills, experience, etc.).
2. **Retriever** — pulls the relevant records from the database.
3. **Context Builder** — assembles retrieved data into a structured context block.
4. **Prompt Builder** — combines the visitor's message with context into a final prompt.
5. **Groq Provider** — sends the prompt to Llama 3.3 (70B) via the Groq API and returns a grounded answer.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend Framework | FastAPI |
| ORM / Database | SQLAlchemy, SQLite |
| Auth | OAuth2 + JWT (`python-jose`), `passlib[bcrypt]` |
| AI / LLM | Groq API (Llama 3.3 70B), ChromaDB (vector storage) |
| Frontend | HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules) |
| Server | Uvicorn (ASGI) |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/) for the AI assistant

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/KAI-OS.git
cd KAI-OS
```

### 2. Set up the backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file inside `backend/` with the following keys:

```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./portfolio.db
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
```

> ⚠️ Never commit your `.env` file. It's already excluded via `.gitignore`.

### 4. Create an admin user

```bash
python create_admin.py
```

### 5. Run the backend server

```bash
cd app
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, with interactive docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### 6. Serve the frontend

Open `frontend/index.html` with a local static server (e.g. the VS Code "Live Server" extension on port `5500`, which is already whitelisted in CORS), or serve it with any static file server of your choice.

The admin dashboard is available at `frontend/admin/index.html`.

## 📡 API Overview

| Resource | Endpoint prefix |
|---|---|
| Authentication | `/auth` |
| Admin | `/admin` |
| Profile | `/profile` |
| Projects | `/project` |
| Research | `/research` |
| Skills | `/skill` |
| Education | `/education` |
| Certifications | `/certification` |
| Resume | `/resume` |
